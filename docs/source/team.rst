Geoffrey Fox
============

Geoffrey Fox received a Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics from Cambridge University and is now professor of Informatics and Computing, and Physics at Indiana University as well as director of the Digital Science Center and Associate Dean for Research and Graduate Studies at the School of Informatics and Computing. He currently works in applying computer science to Bioinformatics, Defense, Earthquake and Ice-sheet Science, Particle Physics and Chemical Informatics and is principal investigator of FutureGrid - a new facility to enable development of new approaches to computing. He is involved in several projects to enhance the capabilities of Minority Serving Institutions.

 

Jack Dongarra	
=============

Jack Dongarra received a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics from Chicago State University in 1972 and a Master of Science in Computer Science from the Illinois Institute of Technology in 1973. He received his Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from the University of New Mexico in 1980. He worked at the Argonne National Laboratory until 1989, becoming a senior scientist. He now holds an appointment as University Distinguished Professor of Computer Science in the Computer Science Department at the University of Tennessee and holds the title of Distinguished Research Staff in the Computer Science and Mathematics Division at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Turing Fellow at Manchester University, and an Adjunct Professor in the Computer Science Department at Rice University. He is the director of the Innovative Computing Laboratory at the University of Tennessee. He is also the director of the Center for Information Technology Research at the University of Tennessee which coordinates and facilitates IT research efforts at the university.

 

Andrew Ng	
=========

Andrew Ng is Associate Professor of Computer Science at Stanford, Chief Scientist of Baidu, and Chairman and Co-founder of Coursera. Ng’s goal is to give everyone in the world access to a great education, for free. He also works on machine learning, with an emphasis on deep learning. Ng founded and led the “Google Brain” project, which developed massive-scale deep learning algorithms. This resulted in the famous “Google cat” result, in which a massive neural network with 1 billion parameters learned from unlabeled YouTube videos to detect cats. More recently, he continues to work on deep learning and its applications to computer vision and speech, including such applications as autonomous driving.

 

Judy Qiu
========

Dr. Qiu is an assistant professor of Computer Science at Indiana University. She graduated from Syracuse University with an Outstanding Graduate Student Award, completing her Ph.D. in Computer Science in 2005. She leads the SALSA project, encompassing data-intensive computing at the intersection of Cloud and multicore technologies, and offers an online course CloudMOOC as part of the Data Science Program of the School of Informatics and Computing. Her research has been funded by NSF, NIH, Microsoft, Google and Indiana University. She is the recipient of a NSF CAREER Award in 2012 and Indiana University Trustees Award For Teaching Excellence in 2013-2014.

Gregor von Laszewski	
====================

Gregor von Laszewski is an Assistant Director of CGL and DSC in the Digital Science Center, School of Informatics and Computing, Indiana University, and an Adjunct Associate Professor at Indiana University in the Computer Science department. He is currently conducting research in cloud computing. He held a position at Argonne National Laboratory from Nov. 1996 - Aug. 2009 where he was a scientist and a fellow of the Computation Institute at University of Chicago. During the last two years of that appointment he was on sabbatical and held a position as Associate Professor and the Director of a Lab at Rochester Institute of Technology focusing on Cyberinfrastructure. He received a Masters Degree in 1990 from the University of Bonn, Germany, and a Ph.D. in 1996 from Syracuse University in Computer Science. He has been involved in Grid computing since the term was coined. Current research interests are in the areas of cloud computing.

 

Adam Coates	
============

Adam Coates is a post-doctoral researcher working under Andrew Ng. Deep learning is his principal focus of research.
