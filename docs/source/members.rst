|Jack Dongarra|

| Jack Dongarra
|  Jack Dongarra received a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics from
  Chicago State University in 1972 and a Master of Science in Computer
  Science from the Illinois Institute of Technology in 1973. He received
  his Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from the University of New Mexico in
  1980. He worked at the Argonne National Laboratory until 1989,
  becoming a senior scientist. He now holds an appointment as University
  Distinguished Professor of Computer Science in the Computer Science
  Department at the University of Tennessee and holds the title of
  Distinguished Research Staff in the Computer Science and Mathematics
  Division at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Turing Fellow at
  Manchester University, and an Adjunct Professor in the Computer
  Science Department at Rice University. He is the director of the
  Innovative Computing Laboratory at the University of Tennessee. He is
  also the director of the Center for Information Technology Research at
  the University of Tennessee which coordinates and facilitates IT
  research efforts at the university.

|Andrew Ng|

| Andrew Ng
|  Andrew Ng is Associate Professor of Computer Science at Stanford,
  Chief Scientist of Baidu, and Chairman and Co-founder of Coursera.
  Ng’s goal is to give everyone in the world access to a great
  education, for free. He also works on machine learning, with an
  emphasis on deep learning. Ng founded and led the “Google Brain”
  project, which developed massive-scale deep learning algorithms. This
  resulted in the famous “Google cat” result, in which a massive neural
  network with 1 billion parameters learned from unlabeled YouTube
  videos to detect cats. More recently, he continues to work on deep
  learning and its applications to computer vision and speech, including
  such applications as autonomous driving.

|Judy Qiu|

| Judy Qiu
|  Dr. Qiu is an assistant professor of Computer Science at Indiana
  University. She graduated from Syracuse University with an Outstanding
  Graduate Student Award, completing her Ph.D. in Computer Science in
  2005. She leads the SALSA project, encompassing data-intensive
  computing at the intersection of Cloud and multicore technologies, and
  offers an online course CloudMOOC as part of the Data Science Program
  of the School of Informatics and Computing. Her research has been
  funded by NSF, NIH, Microsoft, Google and Indiana University. She is
  the recipient of a NSF CAREER Award in 2012 and Indiana University
  Trustees Award For Teaching Excellence in 2013-2014.

|Gregor von Laszewski|

| Gregor von Laszewski
|  Gregor von Laszewski is an Assistant Director of CGL and DSC in the
  Pervasive Technology Institute and an Adjunct Associate Professor at
  Indiana University in the Computer Science department. He is currently
  conducting research in cloud computing as part of the FutureGrid
  project in which he also serves as software architect. He held a
  position at Argonne National Laboratory from Nov. 1996 – Aug. 2009
  where he was a scientist and a fellow of the Computation Institute at
  University of Chicago. During the last two years of that appointment
  he was on sabbatical and held a position as Associate Professor and
  the Director of a Lab at Rochester Institute of Technology focusing on
  Cyberinfrastructure. He received a Masters Degree in 1990 from the
  University of Bonn, Germany, and a Ph.D. in 1996 from Syracuse
  University in Computer Science. He has been involved in Grid computing
  since the term was coined. Current research interests are in the areas
  of cloud computing.

|Terry Moore|

| Terry Moore
|  Terry Moore is currently Associate Director of the Innovative
  Computing Laboratory at the Computer Science Department at University
  of Tennessee. He received his BA in Philosophy from Purdue University
  and his Ph.D. in Philosophy from the University of North Carolina,
  Chapel Hill. His research interests include collaboration
  technologies, distributed and grid computing, software ecosystems,
  long term digital preservation and data logistics.

|Piotr Luszczek|

| Piotr Luszczek
|  Piotr Luszczek is a Research Director at the University of Tennessee.
  His research interests are in large-scale parallel algorithms,
  numerical analysis, and high-performance computing. He has been
  involved in the development and maintenance of widely used software
  libraries for numerical linear algebra. In addition, he specializes in
  computer benchmarking of supercomputers using codes based on linear
  algebra, signal processing, and PDE solvers. Piotr received his
  doctorate degree for independent research work on sparse matrix
  methods including direct factorization and iterative solver
  optimization, all of which leveraged optimized linear algebra kernel
  codes and novel algorithmic techniques. As a Research Director at the
  University of Tennessee, he investigated performance modeling and
  evaluation in the context of tuning of parallelizing compilers as well
  as energy and power aspects of heterogeneous and embedded computing.
  His current work involves large-scale benchmarking based on sparse PDE
  solvers.

|Jakub Kurzak|
