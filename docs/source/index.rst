RAPYDLI Project
===============

The Rapid Python Deep Learning Infrastructure (RaPyDLI) project is
based on the objective to combine high level Python, C/C++ and Java
environments with carefully designed libraries supporting GPU
accelerators and MIC coprocessors. Interactive analysis and
visualization will be supported together with scaling from the current
terabyte size to Petabyte datasets to enable substantial progress in
the complexity and capability of the DL applications. A broad range of
storage models will be supported including network file systems,
databases and HDFS. The partnership of Indiana University, University
of Tennessee-Knoxville, and Stanford University combines leaders in
parallel computing algorithms and run times, Big Data, clouds, and
deep learning.

From May 31 to June 2, 2015, Prof. Geoffrey Fox attended the NSF XPS
Workshop in Arlington, VA. On June 2 he gave a presentation that
included a poster detailing individual components of the RaPyDLI
project and their current state. Click on the image to the right to
view the poster displayed during the workshop.
