Chief Scientist of Baidu, and Chairman and Co-founder of Coursera.
Ngâs goal is to give everyone in the world access to a great
education, for free. He also works on machine learning, with an
emphasis on deep learning. Ng founded and led the âGoogle Brainâ
project, which developed massive-scale deep learning algorithms. This
resulted in the famous âGoogle catâ result, in which a massive neural
network with 1 billion parameters learned from unlabeled YouTube
videos to detect cats. More recently, he continues to work on deep
learning and its applications to computer vision and speech, including
such applications as autonomous driving.</div>
